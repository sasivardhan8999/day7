        <strong>Embracing new challenges to sustaining our legacy</strong>
      After posting record sales and operating profits the previous year, Samsung Electronics set its sights on a new challenge as it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2019. Since then, Samsung has continually strived to become No. 1 in the system semiconductor industry while simultaneously driving growth in areas such as AI and 5G.
     The company has continued to innovate to remain a world leader in memory semiconductors, TVs, and smartphones.
     In 2019, Samsung also declared its new CSR vision: “Together for Tomorrow! Enabling People.” The strategy outlined the company’s commitments as a global corporate citizen, articulating how Samsung strives to fulfill its social responsibilities and the ethos the company will adopt for the next century and beyond.
